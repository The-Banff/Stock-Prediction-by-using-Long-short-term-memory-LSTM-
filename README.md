# Stock-Prediction-by-using-Long-short-term-memory-LSTM-
In this project, LSTM will be using to predict future stock price.

# Univariate LSTM
Univariate LSTM will consider only a single series of observations (other variables will not account into the model) and a model is required to learn from the series of past observations to predict the next value in the sequence. Therefore, adjusted closing price is the variable that being used to input into the model, and predict the next adjusted closing price.

# 5 stocks and S&P 500
This project will use the historical closing price of AAPL, GOOG, NFLX, TSLA to predict the future closing price. Besides, S&P 500 is the benchmark index in this project. This project will analyse the volatility of the stocks, as compared to S&P 500.
